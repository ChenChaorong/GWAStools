### Description
A list of useful tools for genome-wide association analysis. Tools mostly developed &amp; maintained by friends and colleagues. Tools that I have frequently used.

### Links
1. [gwasTools](https://github.com/ilarsf/gwasTools) - a collection of R scripts for plotting GWAS results (Power plot, Manhattan plot, QQ plot)

2. [LocusZoom](http://locuszoom.sph.umich.edu/) - a suite of interactive tools to provide fast visualization of GWAS results for research and publication.

3. [SWISS](https://github.com/welchr/swiss) - software to help identify overlap between association scan results and GWAS hit catalogs.
It can also be used to obtain a set of independent (LD-pruned) loci from a given set of loci.
